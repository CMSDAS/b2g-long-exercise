title: "Systematic uncertainties affecting signal and background"
teaching: 10
exercises: 50
questions:
- "What are systematic uncertainties affecting the signal modelling?"
- "What are systematic uncertainties affecting the background modelling and estimation?"
- "How are we going to evaluate the different systematics?"
objectives:
- "Understand how one estimates various systematic uncertainties."
- "Expose to using Combine framework."
keypoints:
- "For every choice of parameter for object defintion, simulation tune, etc, we must vary the value chosen and rerun the analysis to understand the full impact."
- "Since this is an all-hadronic search the corrections to the Jet Energy Scale are important."
- "Combine is a software package that uses a 'card' (parameter set) to perform the systematic variations to the analysis."
