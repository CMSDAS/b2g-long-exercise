title: "Bonus: Calibrating a jet subtructure tagger."
teaching: 15
exercises: 45
questions:
- "How can I validate a jet substructure tagger in data?"
- "What can be done if a tagger (object-selection technique) performs differently in data vs simulation?"
objectives:
- "Implement a selection that is enriched in boosted W bosons and top quarks."
- "Extract efficiency scale factors."
keypoints:
- "We can define tagger scale factors by measuring the efficiency of the tagger in t+W enriched regions."
