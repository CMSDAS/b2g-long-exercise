title: "Obtaining upper cross section limits"
teaching: 10
exercises: 50
questions:
- "How can I use the infomation from performing systematic variations to quantify the results of my observation?"
- "How can I determine the sensitivity of my analysis? Can this be defined in simulation-only?"
- "Once I unblind, did we find new physics? If not, what can we say?"
objectives:
- "Understand and determine goodness-of-fit."
- "Provide expected senstivity (upper cross-section limmits) before unblinding as a function of resonance mass."
- "Unblind and compare observed to expected limits."
- "Bonus: Implement signal injection tests."
keypoints:
- "We can define expected sensitivity of an analysis with simulation-only by assuming the data expected will be exactly what the background estimation predicts."
- "We combine the systematic variations as a 1/2-sigma envelope around nominal expectation to quantify the confidence of our measurement."
- "After unblinding, if we have a down-fluctuation of data the expected exclusion appears stronger and vice-versa with up-fluctionations and apparently weak exclusions."
